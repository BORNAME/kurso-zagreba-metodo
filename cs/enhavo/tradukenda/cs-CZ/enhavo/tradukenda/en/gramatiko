# _-u_ in Noun Clauses

The imperative ending _-u_ is used not only (as we have already seen) in direct commands and so on, but also in indirect speech in clauses introduced by _ke_ after verbs of commanding, requesting, advising, whishing. (These often correspond to English clauses with "to".)

- _Mi deziras, **ke** vi lern__u__._ – I want you to learn (lit.: I want that you learn.)
- _La patro insistas, **ke** mi iru._ – Father insists that I go.

# The Preposition _je_

The preposition _je_ is kind of a joker. It has no precise meaning, but is used where no other preposition covers the exact meaning one wishes to express. Amongst other things, it is the usual word for translating "at" when telling the time.

- _**Je** kioma horo vi venos?_ – What time will you come? (lit.: At the how-manyeth hour?)
- _**Je** la kvina horo._ – At five o'clock.

# The Verb _Farti_

This verb is mainly used in the expression:

- _Kiel vi **fartas**?_ – How are you?

# The Suffix _-et_

is used to make diminutives:

- _libr__et__o_ – booklet
- _bel__et__a_  – pretty
- _varm__et__a_ – tepid

# The Suffix _-eg_

is used to make augmentatives

- _libr_ego__    – tome
- _varm__eg__a_  – blazing hot
- _bel__eg__a_   – superb
- _bon__eg__a_   – excellent

# The Suffix _-iĝ_

means "to become", "to get":

- _riĉiĝi_          – to grow rich
- _trankvil__iĝ__i_ – to calm down, to become calm
- _resan__iĝ__i_    – to get well again, to recover
