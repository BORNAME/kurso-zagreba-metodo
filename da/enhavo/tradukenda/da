# Adjectives

The adjectival ending is _**-a**_, e.g.

- _bel__a___ – beautiful
- _grand__a__ frato_ – big brother
- _malgrand__a__ fratino_ – little sister

# Cases

Esperanto nouns have two cases, nominative and accusative. The accusative is used to show the object of a transitive verb (the person or thing affected by the action of the verb).

- _Kiu__n__ mi vidas?_ – Who__m__ do I see?
- _Mi vidas amiko__n___ – I see a friend.

Do not use the accusative after the verb "to be" or its equivalents.

Adjectives agree with the nouns they qualify: they take the same _**-j**_ and _**-n**_ endings.

- _Vi estas bon__a__ amik__o___ – You're a good friend.
- _Vi estas bon__aj__ amik__oj___ – You're good friends.
- _Vi havas bon__an__ amik__on___ – You have a good friend.
- _Vi havas bon__ajn__ amik__ojn___ – You have good friends.

Esperanto expresses other case relationships through the use of prepositions. The English possesive is rendered by _**de**_:

- _La libroj **de** mia frato._ – My brother's books.

# The conjuction _ke_

is used to introduce a noun clause. Unlike its English equivalent "that"

1. it cannot be omitted, and
2. it is usually preceded by a comma.

Examples:

- _Vi vidas **ke** mi manĝas._ – You see that I'm eating.
- _Li diras **ke** li iros._ – He says he'll go.

# The prefix _mal-_

changes the meaning of a word to its opposite.

- _bona_ – good
  - ___mal__bona_ – bad
- _granda_ – big, great
  - ___mal__granda_ – little, small
- _bela_ – beautiful
  - ___mal__bela_ – ugly

# The prefix _ge-_

denotes both sexes together:

- ___ge__fratoj_ – brothers and sisters
- ___ge__patroj_ – parents

# Polite expressions

- _**bonvolu**_ – please, be so good as to
- _**dankon**_ – thank you
- _**saluton**_ – hello, hi

# Word order

The usual order of words in the sentence is subject-verb-object, as in English. However, since the accusative ending _-n_ of the object makes it clear which is the subject and which the object, word order can be varied for stylistic or pragmatic purposes, very much more readily in Esperanto than in English.

- _Mi legas libron._ – I'm reading a book.
- _Libron mi legas._ – (A book is what I'm reading.)

# _Kio, Kion_

_Kio_ means "what", as subject of the sentence:

- _**Kio** estas tio?_ – What's that?
- _**Kio** estas sur la tablo?_ – What is on the table?

Where "what" is the object of the verb, the Esperanto equivalent is _Kion_:

- _**Kion** vi faras?_ – What are you doing?
- _**Kion** ŝi diris?_ – What did she say?
