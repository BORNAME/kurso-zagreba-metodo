# Negation

The rules for negation are much as in English.

- _**Nek** li **nek** ŝi respondis._   – Neither he or she answered.

- _Vi **nek** sidas **nek** rigardas._ – You are neither sitting nor looking.

- _Mi **neniam** diros al iu._ – I shall never tell anyone. (_Mi neniam diros al neniu_ is wrong in Esperanto just as "I shan't never tell no-one" is in English.)

# _Mem_

_Mem_ means "self" (myself, yourself, himself etc.) and is used to emphasize the noun or pronoun it follows. (Compare _si_, reflexive, lesson 4.)

- _Mi **mem** faris tion._  – I myself did that, I did that myself.

# Bye…

There are various ways of saying "goodbye" in Esperanto, but the most usual is

- _ĝis la revido_ – literally  "until the re-seeing" (Compare English "see you", French "au revoir".)

Alternatively it may be said without the article:

- _ĝis revido_.

# The Prefix _ek-_

shows

1. the beginning of an action, or
2. a sudden momentary action.

Examples:

- ___ek__paroli_  – to start speaking
- ___ek__silenti_ – to fall silent
- ___ek__sidi_    – to sit down, to take a seat
- ___ek__ridi_    – to burst out laughing

# The Suffix _-aĵ_

means "thing", a concrete object:

- _manĝ__aĵ__o_  – food
- _trink__aĵ__o_ – drink, beverage
- _bel__aĵ__o_   – something beautiful
- _send__aĵ__o_  – something sent, a missive
