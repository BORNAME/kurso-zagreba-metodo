# Numerals

The numerals are listed in the appendix. Higher numbers are formed by combining elementary numerals as follows:

- 1 238                     – _mil du-cent tri-dek ok_
- 153 837                   – _cent kvin-dek tri mil ok-cent tri-dek sep_
- Addition:      8 + 3 = 11 – _ok plus tri estas dek-unu_
- Subtraction:   15 - 6 = 9 – _dek-kvin minus ses estas naŭ_

# Accusative of Motion Towards

Esperanto prepositions are normally followed by the nominative case:

- _post mi_ – after me
- _sen ŝi_ – without her
- _en domo_ – in a house

However, prepositions describing place may be followed by an accusative to show motion toward, e.g.

- _Mi iras en la domo__n__._ – I am going into the house.
- (Compare: _Ili manĝas en la domo._ – They are eating in the house.)

Another example:

- _La kato saltis sur la tablo__n__._ – The cat jumped onto the table.
- _La kato saltis sur la tablo._ – The cat jumped around on the table.

# The pronoun _oni_

The indefinite pronoun _oni_ means

- people (in general)
- they
- you.

Examples:

- _**Oni** manĝas._ – People are eating.
- _**Oni** sidas._ – People are sitting.

# The reflexive pronoun _si_

The pronoun _si_ (accusative \*sin) refers back to the subject of the clause:

- himself
- herself
- itself
- themselves
- oneself

Examples:

- _Li lavas **sin**._ – He washes himself.
- _Ŝi rigardas **sin**._ – She looks at herself.
- _Ili kantas al **si**._ – They are singing to themselves.

_si_ is used only in referring to a third-person subject. It is never itself the subject of a sentence. Compare:

- _Mi rigardas min._ – I look at myself.
- _Ili rigardas sin._ – They look at themselves.

# The prefix _re-_

Like English "re-", it can mean either

- "again, a second time"
- or "back".

Examples:

- ___re__vidi_ – to see again

- ___re__doni_ – to give back

- ___re__meti_ – to put back, to replace
