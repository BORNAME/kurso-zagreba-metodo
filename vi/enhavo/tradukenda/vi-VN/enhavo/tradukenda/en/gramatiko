# Alphabet

The Esperanto alphabet consists of 28 letters: a, b, c, ĉ, d, e, f, g, ĝ, h, ĥ, i, j, ĵ, k, l, m, n, o, p, r, s, ŝ, t, u, ŭ, v, z.

Note the following differences from English:

- **a** as in "father"
- **c** = ts as in "Betsy"
- **ĉ** = ch as in "church"
- **e** as in "there"
- **g** as in "give"
- **ĝ** as in "judge"
- **h** as in "hammer"
- **ĥ** = Scottish ch as in "Loch"
- **i** as in "machine"
- **j** = y as in "yes". **aj**, **ej**, **oj**, **uj** are diphtongs consisting respectivel of a, e, o, u plus a short i-sound. Thus
  - **aj** = i in "die"
  - **ej** = a in "face"
  - **oj** = oy in "boy"
  - **uj** = ui in "ruin", prnounced quickly.
- **ĵ** = zh  as in "measure"
- **o**  as in "north"
- **r** is always pronounced – ideally, rolled
- **s** as in "sense"
- **ŝ** = sh in "sharp"
- **u** as in "fool"
- **ŭ** = w as in "tower". **aŭ**, **eŭ** are diphtongs consisting respectively of "a" or "e" plus a short oo-sound. Thus
  - aŭ = ou in "mouth"
  - eŭ is as "eh-oo".

# Pronunciation

Words are pronounced exactly as spelled, applying the equivalents mentioned above, e.g.

- _amiko_ = ah-MEE-koh
- _ĉambro_ = CHAHM-broh
- _ĝi_ = jee.

# Stress

Words of more than one syllable are stressed on the last syllable but one, e.g.

- _te-le-FO-no_ (teh-leh-FOH-noh)
- _ra-DI-o_ (rah-DEE-oh)
- _kaj_ (kigh)
- a-MI-ko (ah-MEE-koh)
- ES-tas (ESS-tahss).
- NB: AN-kaŭ (because kaŭ is a single syllable).

Be careful over words like historio (hi-sto-RI-o, hee-stoh-REE-oh).

# Article

The definite article is _la_ (– \*the). It is invariable (no change for gender, case or number). There is no indefinite article:

- _la amiko_ – the friend
  - _amiko_ – a friend
- _la laboro_ – the work
  - _laboro_ – work

# Personal Pronouns

- _mi_ – I
- _vi_ – you
- _li_ – he
- _ŝi_ – she
- _ĝi_ – it
- _ni_ – we
- _ili_ – they

The pronouns _li, ŝi, ĝi_ are used in just the same way as English "he, she, it".

# Possessive Pronouns

These are formed by adding the ending **a** to the simple pronouns:

- _mia_ – my
- _via_ – your
- _lia_ – his
- _ŝia_ – her
- _ĝia_ – its
- _nia_ – our
- _ilia_ – their

# Nouns

All nouns end in -O. There is no grammatical gender: where appropriate, feminine sex is indicated by a suffix.

- _tabl__o___ – table
- _lernant__o___ – learner
- _lernant__in__o_ – learner (female)

# Plural

The plural ending is **j**. Both nouns and adjectives take this ending, e.g.:

- _tablo__j___ – tables
- _lernanto__j___ – learners
- _via__j__ lernanto__j___ – your learners

# Verbs

1. The infinitive ending is **-i**, e.g.
   - _lern__i___ – to learn
   - _labor__i___ – to work
   - _est__i___ – to be.
2. The present tense ending is **-as**. It is the same for all persons and numbers:
   - _mi sid__as___ – I sit
   - _vi sid__as___ – you sit
   - _ni sid__as___ – we sit
   - _ili sid__as___ – they sit.

# _Ĉu?_

This is an interrogative particle, used to turn a statement into a yes/no question:

- _**Ĉu** vi sidas?_ – Are you sitting?
- _**Ĉu** vi skribas?_ – Are you writing? Do you write?

# _Kiu?_

This interrogative functions both as a pronoun ("who?") and as an adjective ("which?"), e.g.

- _**Kiu** vi estas?_ – Who are you?
- _**Kiu** instruisto sidas?_ – Which teacher is sitting?

# The Suffix _-ist_

is used to form the name of a person regularly engaged in some activity, e.g.

- _instru__ist__o_ – teacher
- _hotel__ist__o_ – hotelier, hotel-keeper
- _esperant__ist__o_ – Esperantist, adherent of Esperanto

# The Suffix _-in_

is used to form the feminine of a noun:

- _patro_ – father
  - _patr__in__o_ – mother
- _lernanto_ – pupil
  - _lernant__in__o_ – pupil (female)
- _instruisto_ – teacher
  - _instruist__in__o_ – (woman) teacher

# Affirmative Particle

_**jes**_ has the same sound and meaning as the English "yes".

- _Ĉu vi estas en la ĉambro?_
  - _**Jes**, mi estas en la ĉambro._

# Negative Particle

_**ne**_ corresponds to "no" (opposite of "yes") and to "not":

- _**Ne**, mi **ne** estas en la ĉambro._
